Wellcome to my homepage. I'm Hiếu (Pronounce: hɪəʊ).
I completed my B.Sc Computer Science degree at [VNU-UET](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/en/), advised by [Dr. Hoang Thanh-Tung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xZU08d0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Viet-Cuong Ta](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=j9_spcUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I'm currently a Research Assistant at [SAIL lab](https://www.sail-research.com/).

#### Primary research interests

I am eager to (i) understand the foundations, strengths, and limitations of models, learning algorithms, and data and (ii) build learning systems better capable of system 2 tasks such as reasoning and planning.
